# Neural Network

Using strictly python and numpy, I developed a Neural Network that implements forward propagation, back propagation, optimizers, and various modular objects to create a Neural Network. 

## Installation

Open your terminal, then copy & paste the command in your desired directory location

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrew011002/Neural-Network.git
```

## Running
Check out mnist.ipynb for a comprehensive example using the MNIST hand written digit dataset.
